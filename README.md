# deep-learning-challenge
Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data. Artificial neural networks are inspired by the human brain, and they can be used to solve a wide variety of problems, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. 

Step 1:
Using your knowledge of Pandas and scikit-learn’s StandardScaler(), you’ll need to preprocess the dataset. This step prepares you for Step 2, where you'll compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model.

Step 2:
Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, you’ll design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. You’ll need to think about how many inputs there are before determining the number of neurons and layers in your model. Once you’ve completed that step, you’ll compile, train, and evaluate your binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.

Step 3:
Optimize the Model
Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, optimize your model to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.

Step 4: 
Write a Report on the Neural Network Model
For this part of the assignment, you’ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
